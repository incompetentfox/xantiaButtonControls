# xantiaButtonControls
##Arduino code to interpret the analog voltage output from certain Citroen steering wheel button controls and convert it to a digital output to control a modern head unit.

Citroen steering wheel buttons designed to interact with factory supplied Blaupunkt and Clarion head units are multiplexed using resistor ladders.

The aim of this project is to convert this signal to a digital output for each button in order to control a more modern audio system. 

A side effect will be enabling 'chording' of two buttons on either side to effectively act as an extra button.
